    ‘Resurrection: Ertugrul’ is an epic story rooted in the historical events 
    of Anatolia (modern-day Turkey). It is the tale of a daring character with 
    enthralling love and a sense of justice that was strong enough to change the 
    fate of the World. The nomadic Kayi tribe of the Oghuz Turks are on a quest 
    to find a place they can finally call home. Ertugrul, the leader of the tribe, 
    leads his people through perseverance against hardship while striving for 
    justice and maintaining the traditions of the land. By battling his enemies 
    with strength and bravery, Ertugrul consequently plants the seed that would 
    lead to the founding of the Ottoman Empire, which had spread across three 
    continents and ruled for six centuries.

    <h3>Ertugrul Bey</h3>
    <p>
    Ertugrul is the father of Osman.  With the small part of Kayi tribe, Ertugurl 
    with only 400 tents, went on the challenging path toward the West and made 
    foundation for one of the greatest empires. After Sultan Aleaddin was poisoned 
    by Sadettin Kopek, he revolted against Kopek’s government, and proclaimed his own 
    State,  the City of Sogut its capitol.

    His love and respect for his wife was widely known. He had four sons with Halime Sultan, 
    and he died at 90 years old. The last ten years of his life were spent quietly in his tribe, 
    when due to the old age, he transferred all his responsibilities to his youngest son Osman. 
    A historical proof of his life are the coins minted by Osman which identify Ertuğrul as the 
    name of his father, but beyond this not much is known about him apart from folktales.

<h3>Turgut Alp</h3>
<p>
He was one of the greatest and most renown warriors in Turkish history, a blood-brother to 
Ertugrul and his best follower and supporter, a very smart and capable man.He lived an unusually 
long life, even for our time. He outlived Erugrul Bey by 35 years, and he was killed in a battle, 
with his legendary battle-axe in his hand aged 125 years old! After Ertugrul passed away, Turgut become 
the main support to Osman, and when Osman established his Sultanate he rewarded Turgut with the highest 
position, as a Governor of the new State.

    <h3>Bamsi Alp</h3>
    <p>
   He was a legendary hero; his life has been described in the book of medieval 
   Ottoman’s chronologies of that time, titled ‘’The book of Dede Korkut”. He was described 
   as the two sworded fighter, a fierce warrior, goodhearted and very funny man. His 
   love life was legendary, since his heart was divided between two loves. He spent 16 
   years in a dungeon in Byzantine, and the Princess, who lived in that Fortress fell in 
   love with him and helped him escape. It is not known when he died or how long he lived; 
   only that he lived fairly long for that time, and that he was ambushed by trickery 
   and killed, leaving behind a wife and children. We may only guess how long this 
   character will be kept in this series.
